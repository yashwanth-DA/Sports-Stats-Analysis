"Sports Basics" is a sports blog company that entered into the market recently. 

They wanted to get more traffic to their website by releasing a special edition magazine on IPL 2024. 

This magazine aims to provide interesting insights and facts for fans, analysts and teams based on the last 3 years' data.
